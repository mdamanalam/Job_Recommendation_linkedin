This is a Recommendation project, Where we have **scrapped the LinkedIn page** to get data about the various features.
The data file contains 9 variables. The goal here is to recommend various job type according to region or state and vice versa.

### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
Job Recommendation systems is typically use the machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior data, such as the Job vacancies, 
location of the job, Company, job type, Involvements, to identify the patterns and make recommendations.
These systems also make use of additional sources such as Employees of the companies, Followers on the LinkedIn, 
Total applicants, Industry, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a Job and improve Recommendation accuracy.
Some common types of jobs are based on the Job names and Locations where most of the people would prefer, 
Job Recommendation system include content based filtering, which recommends abortive filtering and suggest jobs based on user preferences, 
here we took Location based Recommendation. 

#### **STEPS PERFORMED**
##### **scrapped the LinkedIn Job Data**
###### **EDA**
###### **VISUALIZATION**
###### **MODEL BUILDING**
Model building in Machine Learning models can be understood as program that has been trained to find patterns within new data and make precisions and obtain the result.
In this project we did model building on the basis of Recommendation. We did recommendation with the help of **Selenium library** also used cosine, correlation similarity and pairwise distances to know distance between two points.
Here we focused on finding cosine-similarity between job.
